<h1 class="text-center mt-4 mb-4 animated fadeInUp "> About the Project</h1>   
<p class="animated fadeIn">
  One web page for every book ever published. It's a lofty but achievable goal.

  To build Open Library, we need hundreds of millions of book records, a wiki interface, and lots of people who are willing to contribute their time and effort to building the site.
  
  To date, we have gathered over 20 million records from a variety of large catalogs as well as single contributions, with more on the way.
  
  Open Library is an open project: the software is open, the data are open, the documentation is open, and we welcome your contribution. Whether you fix a typo, add a book, or write a widget--it's all welcome. We have a small team of fantastic programmers who have accomplished a lot, but we can't do it alone!</p>
